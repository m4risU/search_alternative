SearchAlternative
=================

This plugin has been created since searchlogic did not appeared on time when rails 3 appeared in beta.
It is supposed to help with table sorting and simple search filters.

Example
=======

Controller:

  def index
    options = {}
    options[:page] = params[:page]
    options[:per_page] = 10

    @search = User.search(params)
    @users = @search.paginate(options)
  end

View:

Simple searching form, that will use table column

  <%= form_tag users_path, :method => :get do %>
    <%= search_tag 'username' %>
    <%= search_tag 'email' %>
    <%= submit_tag 'Search' %>
  <% end %>

Some additional filtering outside of form.

<%= filter 'fancy_scope', :as => 'Show only those with fancy feature' %>

This helper will produce link that will attach some search parametres. It will call on your model scope named filter_by_fancy_scope

class User
  scope :filter_by_fancy_feature, { where("fancy") }
end

You can pass additional parameter in :filter_params.

<%= filter 'fancy_scope', :as => 'Show only those with fancy feature', :filter_params => 34 %>
<%= filter 'fancy_scope', :as => 'Show only those with fancy feature', :filter_params => 'fancy_argument' %>
<%= filter 'fancy_scope', :as => 'Show only those with fancy feature', :filter_params => [15,67,89] %>

You will need of course named scope that will know what to do with this param. As example:

class User
  scope :filter_by_fancy_feature, lambda {|param| where("fancy = ?",param) }
end
