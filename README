SearchAlternative
=================

This plugin has been created since searchlogic did not appeared on time when rails 3 appeared in beta.
It is supposed to help with table sorting and simple search filters.

Example
=======

Controller:

  def index
    options = {}
    options[:page] = params[:page]
    options[:per_page] = 10

    @search = User.search(params)
    @users = @search.paginate(options)
  end

View:

  <%= form_tag users_path, :method => :get do %>
    <%= search_tag 'username' %>
    <%= search_tag 'email' %>
    <%= submit_tag 'Search' %>
  <% end %>
